                <h1>Interactive Explanation of Schmitz Particle Approximation</h1>

                    <p>
                    This is an interactive explanation of Leonardo Schmitz's
                    particle-based vertex approximation.
                    This technique replaces QEF solving in dual contouring.

                    <p>
                    We start with a set of intersection points and a normal
                    vector for each. <strong>Click and drag</strong> to change these.
                    You can add or remove points, one per edge.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s2">
                    <p>
                    A point and a normal vector combined define a plane.
                    Each plane passes through its point and is perpendicular
                    to its normal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our goal is to find a point inside the cell that is closest
                    to all planes.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s3">
                    <p>
                    For every combination of cell corner and plane, we find the
                    shortest vector that takes the corner to the plane.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s4">
                    <p>
                    For each corner, we add up its vectors. The resulting
                    sum, called a "force", is multiplied by a small constant,
                    such as 0.05.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s5">
                    <p>
                    Our particle starts at the mass center of the cell. This
                    is the average of all intersection points.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s6">
                    <p>
                        We combine the forces in a single force through
                        trilinear interpolation in relation to the particle.
                        Each partial force's contribution is proportional to
                        the opposing volume.  This means the closer the
                        particle is to a corner, the greater the effect of that
                        corner's force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The resulting force is added to the particle position.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" id="s7">
                    <p>
                    With a new particle position, we repeat the interpolation.
                    The particle is clamped so it never leaves the cell.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" id="s8">
                    <p>
                    That's it! The final particle is a good approximation of
                    the cell's optimal vertex.
